# SnapRemover
Select the friends.json file from your requested and downlaoded snapchat data

select the category you want to see

remove these people (eg. your quickadds)

right now you can have a look over your friends database through the json file Eg which friends you have blocked etc

I will try to add features to remove people as well, but it might be a trash solution since Snapchat web doesn't allow to remove people

in pycharm you need to install these modules / any missing one
# On Windows
py -m pip install pyautogui


# On Mac
python3 -m pip install pyautogui
